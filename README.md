# Purpose

Shows how to use AWS with Terraform to accomplish the following tasks:

* How to build an AWS data lake with Terraform
 

# Prerequisites

* You must have an AWS account, and have your default credentials and AWS Region
  configured
* You must have Terraform installed
* You must own a Domain


# Cautions

* As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, or only the 
  permissions required to perform a task. For more information, see 
  [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) 
  in the *AWS Identity and Access Management 
  User Guide*.
* This code has been tested in us-west-1 AWS Regions only. However it should work in any other region. 
* Running this code __it will__ result in charges to your AWS account.
* # Only for testing and not production tls_private_key: Important Security Notice
The private key generated by this resource will be stored unencrypted in your Terraform state file. Use of this resource for production deployments is not recommended. Instead, generate a private key file outside of Terraform and distribute it securely to the system where Terraform will be run.

# How to run this code

- [How to run this code](#how-to-run-this-code)
  - [Quick Start](#quick-start)
  - [Quick Destroy](#quick-destroy)
  - [Notes](#notes)

## Quick Start

It will deploy to the account setup for the aws cli called 'default'

```bash
cd AWS_DataLake
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

## Quick Destroy

```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

## Notes

- clone this Git repo
- cd to the the directory AWS_DataLake
- use terraform __init__ command to initialize the Terraform working directory and to download plugins for a provider (aws)
- terraform validate command will validate the code before actual deployment
- terraform plan command will show the execution code before making the actual deployment
- terraform apply
- Alternate command : terraform apply -auto-approve
- terraform destroy
- Alternate command : terraform destroy -auto-approve
- terraform fmt -recursive # A way to format the terraform code
